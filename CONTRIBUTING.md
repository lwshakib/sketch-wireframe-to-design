## 📝 Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- **Use TypeScript** for all new code
- **Enable strict mode** - no `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- **Define interfaces** for all data structures
- **Use type inference** where possible

### React/Next.js

- **Use functional components** with hooks
- **Follow React best practices**:
  - Keep components small and focused
  - Use custom hooks for reusable logic
  - Memoize expensive computations with `useMemo`
  - Use `useCallback` for event handlers passed to children
- **Use Next.js App Router** conventions
- **Server Components by default**, use Client Components only when needed

### File Naming

- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `UserMenu.tsx`)
- **Utilities**: camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.ts`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `API_ENDPOINTS.ts`)
- **Hooks**: camelCase with `use` prefix (e.g., `useAuth.ts`)

### Code Style

- **Use Prettier** for formatting (configured in the project)
- **2 spaces** for indentation
- **Single quotes** for strings
- **Semicolons** at the end of statements
- **Trailing commas** in multi-line objects/arrays
- **Max line length**: 100 characters

### Component Structure

```tsx
// 1. Imports
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

// 2. Types/Interfaces
interface MyComponentProps {
  title: string;
  onAction: () => void;
}

// 3. Component
export function MyComponent({ title, onAction }: MyComponentProps) {
  // 4. Hooks
  const [state, setState] = useState(false);

  // 5. Event handlers
  const handleClick = () => {
    setState(true);
    onAction();
  };

  // 6. Render
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### CSS/Styling

- **Use Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Follow mobile-first** approach
- **Use CSS variables** for theming
- **Avoid inline styles** unless dynamic
- **Use `cn()` utility** for conditional classes

### Database

- **Use Prisma** for all database operations
- **Write migrations** for schema changes
- **Use transactions** for related operations
- **Index frequently queried fields**

### API Routes

- **Validate input** using Zod or similar
- **Handle errors** gracefully
- **Return consistent response format**:
  ```typescript
  // Success
  { success: true, data: {...} }
  
  // Error
  { success: false, error: "Error message" }
  ```

## 📝 Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Performance improvement
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```bash
feat(canvas): add undo/redo functionality
fix(auth): resolve session timeout issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
style(ui): improve button hover states
refactor(api): simplify chat endpoint logic
perf(rendering): optimize frame rendering performance
test(auth): add unit tests for login flow
chore(deps): update dependencies
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- **Write tests** for all new features
- **Update tests** when modifying existing code
- **Test edge cases** and error conditions
- **Use descriptive test names**

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should render correctly', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle user interaction', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle errors gracefully', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### General

- **Keep PRs focused** - one feature/fix per PR
- **Write clear commit messages** following conventions
- **Test thoroughly** before submitting
- **Be responsive** to feedback and review comments
